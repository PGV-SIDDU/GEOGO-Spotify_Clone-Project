This is `React-Spotify`, a React front end client that communicates with the Spotify API.

See it in action [here](https://pgv-siddu.github.io/GEOGO-Spotify_Clone-Project/).


If you wish to run the code locally run the following.

```
yarn
yarn start
visit http://localhost:3000
```

You can also run as an electron app by running `yarn run electron-start`.

Please note that the Spotify API only provides 30 second audio snippets. It may be possible to get the full track by using the [Web Playback SDK](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/).
